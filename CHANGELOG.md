# Changelog - Version 2.0

## üéâ Major Enhancements Based on User Feedback

### ‚úÖ 1. Real-Time Status Feedback
**Problem**: Users couldn't see what was happening during processing
**Solution**: 
- Status messages for every step ("Generating question...", "Creating JSON...", "Analyzing...")
- Real-time timer showing elapsed time (‚è± 15s, ‚è± 1m 23s)
- Clear progress indicators throughout

### ‚úÖ 2. JSON Mode for Two-Stage Processing
**Problem**: Couldn't use different models for JSON generation vs. assessment
**Solution**:
- **Form Input** mode (original): Generate JSON from scratch
- **JSON Input** mode (new): Upload or paste pre-generated JSON
- Allows workflow: Use cheap model for JSON ‚Üí Use premium model for assessment
- Upload .json files or paste directly

### ‚úÖ 3. Enhanced Download Options - Single Mode
**Problem**: No way to save intermediate or final results
**Solution**:
- **Step 2 (JSON Ready)**: Download assessment data as JSON
- **Step 3 (Complete)**: 
  - Download assessment as TXT (for student feedback)
  - Download complete JSON (includes question, answers, rubric, AND assessment)

### ‚úÖ 4. Enhanced Download Options - Batch Mode
**Problem**: Only one output format, no progress details
**Solution**:
- **Text Format**: Individual TXT files for each student (original)
- **JSON Format**: Individual JSON files with complete data structure
- Each file named after student's original filename
- Errors saved separately for easy identification

### ‚úÖ 5. Improved Batch Progress Tracking
**Problem**: "Processing..." was vague
**Solution**:
- **File Counter**: "3 of 15 completed"
- **Current File**: Shows which file is being processed
- **Timer**: Elapsed time display
- **Status Updates**: What's happening right now
- **Completion Summary**: X successful, Y errors

### ‚úÖ 6. Button Improvements
**Problem**: Buttons didn't show count or what would happen
**Solution**:
- Batch button shows: "Process All Files (15)" 
- Download buttons show format: "Download Text Files (ZIP)" vs "Download JSON Files (ZIP)"
- Icons for clarity üì• üìÑ üìù

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Two-Stage Processing (Cost Savings!)
```
Stage 1: Generate JSON (cheap model)
1. Switch to Single Assessment
2. Use Form Input mode
3. Select GLM-4.5 (FREE) or Gemini Flash (cheap)
4. Paste student answer
5. Generate ‚Üí Download JSON

Stage 2: Assess (premium model)
1. Switch to JSON Input mode
2. Select Claude Sonnet 4.5 (best quality)
3. Upload/paste the JSON from Stage 1
4. Generate Assessment
5. Download TXT or JSON

Cost: $0.02 (generation) + $0.08 (assessment) = $0.10
vs. $0.15 if using premium model for both
```

### Example 2: Batch Processing with Progress Monitoring
```
1. Upload 25 student PDFs
2. Start processing
3. Watch real-time:
   - "3 of 25 completed"
   - "Currently: Smith_John.pdf"
   - "‚è± Elapsed: 2m 15s"
   - "ü§ñ Analyzing legal writing..."
4. Complete: "20 successful, 5 errors"
5. Download as JSON for programmatic processing
   OR download as TXT for manual review
```

### Example 3: Archiving Complete Assessments
```
After assessment:
1. Download "Complete JSON" which includes:
   - Original question
   - Student answer
   - Model answer
   - Rubric
   - Full assessment feedback

2. Replace index.html
3. Everything works the same, plus new features!

### To use new features:
1. **JSON Mode**: Click "JSON Input" toggle before processing
2. **Download buttons**: Look for them at Step 2 and Step 3
3. **Batch formats**: Two download buttons instead of one

## Future Roadmap

Based on this feedback cycle, considering:
- [ ] Pause/Resume for batch processing
- [ ] Save progress locally (survive page refresh)
- [ ] Export to CSV for grade import
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison view
- [ ] Bulk JSON upload for batch mode
- [ ] Custom status webhooks
