## 🎯 What It Does

### Core Functionality

1. **Intelligent JSON Generation**
   - Takes student answer as minimum input
   - Auto-generates missing components (question, model answer, rubric)
   - Maintains proper order and dependencies

2. **AI-Powered Assessment**
   - Evaluates using professional legal writing frameworks
   - Identifies conclusory statements
   - Analyzes fact-to-rule connections
   - Checks analogical reasoning
   - Provides Socratic feedback questions

3. **Privacy-First Design**
   - No backend servers
   - No data collection
   - API keys stay in browser
   - Direct API calls only

## 🚀 How to Deploy (Choose One)

### Option 1: Automated Script (Easiest)
