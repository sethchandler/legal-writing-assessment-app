## Best Practices

### 1. Provide Context Upfront
‚úÖ **DO**: Upload question, model answer, and rubric before batch processing
‚ùå **DON'T**: Let the tool generate these for every file

**Savings**: If you have 30 files and don't provide context:
- Without context: 90 API calls (30 √ó 3 generation calls each)
- With context: 30 API calls (1 assessment call each)

### 2. Test with Sample First
‚úÖ **DO**: Process 2-3 files first to verify setup
‚ùå **DON'T**: Upload 100 files without testing

### 3. Use Consistent File Naming
‚úÖ **DO**: Name files descriptively
- `Smith_John_Essay1.pdf`
- `Jones_Sarah_FinalExam.docx`

‚ùå **DON'T**: Use generic names
- `answer1.pdf`
- `file.docx`

Assessment files will match your naming.

### 4. Choose the Right Model
**For large batches (50+ files):**
- Claude Haiku 4.5 (fast & cheap)
- Gemini 2.5 Flash (very affordable)
- GLM-4.5 via OpenRouter (free!)

**For important assessments:**
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (best quality)
- GPT-5 (strong alternative)

### 5. Monitor Progress
Watch the real-time status indicators:
- ‚è≥ Pending ‚Üí waiting
- ‚öôÔ∏è Processing ‚Üí currently working on this file
- ‚úÖ Complete ‚Üí assessment ready
- ‚ùå Error ‚Üí check error message

### 6. Handle Errors Gracefully
If files fail:
1. Check error message in `[filename]_ERROR.txt`
2. Common issues:
   - Corrupted PDF/DOCX
   - Scanned PDF (no extractable text)
   - API rate limit hit
   - Invalid file format
3. Fix issues and reprocess failed files

## File Format Tips

### PDF Files
‚úÖ **Good**: Text-based PDFs (created digitally)
‚ùå **Bad**: Scanned PDFs (images of text)

**Solution for scanned PDFs**: Use OCR software first, or have students submit DOCX

### Word Files
‚úÖ **Good**: Standard .docx files
‚ùå **Bad**: Password-protected files

**Solution**: Have students remove password protection before submission

### Text/Markdown Files
‚úÖ **Always work perfectly**
- Simplest format
- Fastest to process
- No compatibility issues

## Cost Examples

### Scenario 1: Small Class (20 Students)
**Without context:**
- Calls: 20 students √ó 4 calls = 80 calls
- Cost with Claude Haiku: ~$4-6

**With context:**
- Calls: 20 students √ó 1 call = 20 calls
- Cost with Claude Haiku: ~$1-1.50

**Savings: ~75%**

### Scenario 2: Large Class (100 Students)
**Without context:**
- Calls: 100 students √ó 4 calls = 400 calls
- Cost with Claude Haiku: ~$20-30

**With context:**
- Calls: 100 students √ó 1 call = 100 calls
- Cost with Claude Haiku: ~$5-8

**Savings: ~75%**

### Scenario 3: Free Tier (Testing)
**Using GLM-4.5 via OpenRouter:**
- Cost: $0 (completely free!)
- Quality: Good for draft feedback
- Speed: Comparable to paid options

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Final Exam Grading
```
1. Switch to Batch Mode
2. Upload: 
   - Question.pdf (the exam question)
   - ModelAnswer.pdf (your answer key)
   - Rubric.pdf (your grading rubric)
3. Upload all student PDFs (50 files)
4. Process
5. Download ZIP
6. Review assessments
7. Copy feedback into LMS
```

### Example 2: Practice Essay Feedback
```
1. Switch to Batch Mode
2. Paste question directly in text box
3. Leave model answer & rubric blank (will generate)
4. Upload student submissions (30 files)
5. Process (takes longer due to generation)
6. Download ZIP
7. Share feedback with students
```

### Example 3: Partial Context
```
1. Switch to Batch Mode
2. Upload only the question
3. Let tool generate model answer & rubric
   (same for all students, generated once then reused)
4. Upload student files
5. Process
6. Download ZIP
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to parse PDF"
**Cause**: Scanned PDF or corrupted file
**Solution**: 
- Use OCR on scanned PDFs
- Re-export PDF from original source
- Convert to DOCX or TXT

### "API rate limit exceeded"
**Cause**: Too many requests too fast
**Solution**:
- Wait 60 seconds and restart
- Process in smaller batches (20-30 at a time)
- Switch to provider with higher limits

### "Out of API credits"
**Cause**: API account has insufficient funds
**Solution**:
- Add credits to your API account
- Switch to OpenRouter free tier (GLM-4.5)

### "Processing stuck at 47%"
**Cause**: Network issue or API timeout
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Refresh page and restart batch
- Successfully processed files are saved

### Empty or garbled text from file
**Cause**: Unusual file encoding or format
**Solution**:
- Open file and re-save in standard format
- Convert to plain .txt file
- Check file isn't corrupted

## Performance Tips

### Speed Optimization
1. **Use faster models**:
   - GPT-5 Instant
   - Gemini 2.5 Flash
   - Claude Haiku 4.5

2. **Provide full context**:
   - Eliminates generation time per file

3. **Process during off-peak hours**:
   - API providers may be faster at certain times

### Quality Optimization
1. **Use premium models**:
   - Claude Sonnet 4.5
   - GPT-5
   - Gemini 2.5 Pro

2. **Provide detailed rubric**:
   - More specific rubric = more targeted feedback

3. **Include model answer**:
   - Enables better comparison and feedback

Process different classes separately:
1. Batch 1: Civil Procedure (with its question/rubric)
2. Reset and start new batch
3. Batch 2: Constitutional Law (with its question/rubric)

**Q: Can I pause and resume?**
A: Not currently. Process in smaller batches if you need flexibility.

**Q: How long does it take?**
A: Depends on:
- Number of files: ~10-30 seconds per file
