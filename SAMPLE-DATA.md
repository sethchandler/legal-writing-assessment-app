# Sample Assessment Data

Use this sample data to test the Legal Writing Assessment Tool.

## Sample Question

John was driving home from work on a rainy evening. As he approached an intersection, he reached down to change the radio station. While distracted, he failed to notice that the traffic light had turned red. John proceeded through the intersection and collided with Mary's car, which had the right of way. Mary suffered a broken arm and significant damage to her vehicle.

Mary has filed a negligence claim against John. Analyze whether John breached his duty of care.

## Sample Student Answer (Needs Improvement)

**Issue:** Did John breach his duty of care?

**Rule:** Negligence requires a duty of care, breach, causation, and damages. A driver has a duty to operate their vehicle with reasonable care. Breach occurs when the driver fails to meet this standard.

**Application:** John was driving and reached down to change the radio. He didn't see the red light. This caused an accident. The defendant's actions were negligent because he wasn't paying attention to the road. A reasonable driver would have seen the red light. John hit Mary's car and she got hurt.

**Conclusion:** John breached his duty of care.

## Sample Model Answer (Demonstrates Excellence)

**Issue:** Whether John breached his duty of care by running a red light while distracted by adjusting his radio.

**Rule:** To establish negligence, a plaintiff must prove the defendant owed a duty of care, breached that duty, the breach caused the injury, and damages resulted. All drivers owe a duty to exercise reasonable care, which includes maintaining attention to traffic signals and road conditions. A breach occurs when a driver's conduct falls below the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise under similar circumstances. The standard is objective—judged by what a reasonable driver would do, not the defendant's subjective beliefs.

**Application:** John owed Mary a duty to operate his vehicle with reasonable care because all drivers have this duty when operating on public roads. John breached this duty because he diverted his attention from the roadway to change the radio station while approaching an intersection—conduct that falls below the reasonable driver standard. A reasonable driver would not manipulate non-essential vehicle controls while approaching an intersection, particularly during adverse weather conditions when heightened attention is required. 

The breach is established through specific facts: John "reached down" to adjust the radio, demonstrating a deliberate diversion of attention from driving, and he subsequently "failed to notice" the traffic signal change to red. These facts satisfy the breach element because they show John's inattention directly resulted from his choice to prioritize radio adjustment over traffic monitoring.

One might argue that momentary inattention should not constitute breach because all drivers occasionally adjust controls. However, this argument fails because the breach standard examines whether the conduct was reasonable under the circumstances—approaching an intersection on a rainy evening while adjusting controls is distinguishable from making minor adjustments on straight, unobstructed roadways with good visibility.

**Conclusion:** John breached his duty of care because his decision to adjust the radio while approaching an intersection in adverse weather fell below the reasonable driver standard and directly caused his failure to observe the traffic signal.

## Sample Rubric

- **Good (38-44)**: Clear connections, addresses counterarguments, sound reasoning
- **Satisfactory (30-37)**: Basic connections, minimal counterarguments, adequate reasoning
- **Needs Work (0-29)**: Conclusory statements, missing connections, weak reasoning

### Rule Statement (20 points)
- **Excellent (18-20)**: Complete, well-organized, proper funnel structure
- **Good (15-17)**: Complete, organized, minor gaps
- **Satisfactory (12-14)**: Mostly complete, some organization issues
- **Needs Work (0-11)**: Incomplete, disorganized, significant gaps

### Issue Spotting (15 points)
- **Excellent (14-15)**: Identifies all key issues, properly framed
- **Good (12-13)**: Identifies main issues, adequate framing
- **Satisfactory (9-11)**: Identifies some issues, basic framing
- **Needs Work (0-8)**: Misses key issues, poor framing

### Organization (15 points)
- **Excellent (14-15)**: Clear structure, smooth transitions, proper format
- **Good (12-13)**: Good structure, adequate transitions
- **Satisfactory (9-11)**: Basic structure, some organization issues

## Expected Assessment Output

When you run this sample through the tool, you should see:

1. **Framework Detection**: IRAC identified
2. **Overall Score**: Approximately 65-70/100
3. **Strengths**:
   - Proper IRAC structure maintained
   - Basic rule statement present
   - Issue properly identified

4. **Major Issues**:
   - Multiple conclusory statements:
     * "The defendant's actions were negligent" (no factual support)
     * "A reasonable driver would have seen the red light" (assertion without connection)
   - Weak fact-to-rule connections
   - Missing counterargument analysis
   - Insufficient detail in breach analysis

5. **Feedback Questions**:
   - "What specific facts demonstrate that John's conduct fell below the reasonable driver standard?"
   - "How exactly does 'reaching down to change the radio' satisfy the breach element?"
   - "What is the strongest argument John could make that his conduct was reasonable?"

## How to Use This Sample

1. **Copy the student answer** into the "Student Answer" field
2. **Leave other fields blank** to test auto-generation, OR
3. **Copy question and rubric** to see how provided context improves assessment
4. **Compare results** when using model answer vs. not using it

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Minimal Input
- Input: Student answer only
- Result: Tool generates question, model answer, and rubric

### Scenario 2: With Question
- Input: Question + Student answer
- Result: Tool generates model answer and rubric contextually

### Scenario 3: Full Context
- Input: All four fields
- Result: Most accurate and detailed assessment

## Expected Differences

**Without Model Answer**:
- Assessment focuses on structural issues
- Identifies conclusory statements
- Provides general improvement guidance

**With Model Answer**:
- Comparison of depth and detail
- Specific examples of stronger analysis
- Targeted revision suggestions based on model
