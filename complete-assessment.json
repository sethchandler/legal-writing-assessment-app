  "question": "\nDave suggested to Fred that they rob a bank. Fred agreed and said that he would go along with Dave when he tries to rob the bank. Unbeknownst to Dave, Fred did not actually want to rob the bank. Rather, he was a member of a terrorist group who wanted to explode a hand grenade in a public place as an act of terror. When Dave asked him to participate in the bank robbery, Fred saw an opportunity to fulfill his goal while having Dave along as an unwitting armed backup. The next day, Dave and Fred approached the bank carrying handguns. Fred also had a hand grenade in his jacket pocket that Dave did not know about. Just as they walked in the bank’s front door with their guns drawn, to Dave’s astonishment, Fred removed the grenade from his pocket, pulled the pin, and threw the grenade into the bank. The explosion damaged the bank, but did not hurt anyone. Bank guard Gus saw Dave and Fred running away with their guns drawn and shot his gun at Fred, killing him. With what crimes may Dave reasonably be charged? Discuss.",
  "studentAnswer": "### Claim\n\nDave may be charged with conspiracy to commit robbery, attempted robbery, and possibly felony murder for Fred’s death.\n\n---\n\n### Rule\n\nA conspiracy occurs when two or more people agree to commit a crime and take an overt act toward its completion. Each conspirator is liable for crimes committed in furtherance of the conspiracy that are reasonably foreseeable. Attempt requires intent to commit the crime and a substantial step toward its completion. Under the felony-murder rule, a killing that occurs during the commission or attempted commission of a dangerous felony—such as robbery—is murder, even if accidental or committed by someone other than the felon, as long as the death is connected to the felony.\n\n---\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe rationale behind conspiracy is that agreement to commit a crime increases the likelihood that it will occur. Therefore, the law punishes the agreement and joint acts even if the crime is not completed. Likewise, attempt punishes conduct that goes beyond mere preparation. Felony murder extends liability to participants in inherently dangerous felonies because the risk of death is high and participants should bear the consequences. However, felony-murder liability may not extend if the killing was not in furtherance of the felony or was committed by someone opposing it (such as a police officer or victim).\n\n---\n\n### Application\n\n**Conspiracy to Commit Robbery:** Dave and Fred agreed to rob a bank. Dave proposed the idea, and Fred agreed to go along. This constitutes an agreement. Their approach to the bank with guns drawn was an overt act. Thus, Dave is guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery. It does not matter that Fred had a different motive; as long as he agreed to rob the bank, the conspiracy is formed.\n\n**Attempted Robbery:** Dave intended to rob the bank and took substantial steps—arming himself, approaching the bank, and drawing his gun. The explosion interrupted the robbery before any money was taken, but those acts likely meet the “substantial step” requirement. Dave is therefore guilty of attempted robbery.\n\n**Destruction of Property/Terrorism-Related Offense:** Fred alone intended to detonate the grenade, but Dave did not share that purpose or even know about it. Since it was outside the scope of the robbery plan, Dave likely is not guilty of the bombing or terrorism-related offense.\n\n**Felony Murder:** Fred was killed by Gus, a bank guard, while the robbery was in progress. Because the death occurred during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony, the prosecution could charge Dave with felony murder. However, a defense might argue that Fred’s death was caused by a third party acting in resistance, which some jurisdictions treat as outside the scope of felony murder. Still, under the proximate cause theory, Dave could be held liable because the death was a foreseeable result of the attempted robbery.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDave can be charged with (1) conspiracy to commit robbery, (2) attempted robbery, and (3) felony murder for Fred’s death. The felony-murder charge is debatable, but most courts would uphold it because the death occurred during an attempted robbery—a dangerous felony that Dave willingly joined.\n\n---\n",
  "modelAnswer": "\nQUESTION 1: SELECTED ANSWER A State v. Dave Solicitation: Requesting, urging, or tempting someone to commit a crime, with the intent that the solicitee commit the crime. Here, the facts state that \"Dave suggested to Fred that they rob a bank.\" Thus, Dave urged Fred to commit a crime, with the specific intent that Fred commit the crime. Therefore, Dave can be found guilty of Solicitation. However, Solicitation merges into the completed crime. Conspiracy: Agreement by two or more persons to commit a crime, with the intent that the crime be committed. Here, \"Fred agreed and said that he would go along with Dave when he tries to rob the bank.\" At Common Law, Conspiracy was complete upon the agreement of the co-conspirator. However, modernly, Conspiracy is a felony and requires some overt act in furtherance of the criminal objective. Here, Dave and Fred approached the bank carrying handguns. Thus, they both committed an overt act in furtherance of the criminal objective, at this point. Additionally, Dave had the specific intent to complete the criminal objective. Therefore, Dave can reasonably be charged with Conspiracy. Feigned Agreement: When only one guilty mind, there can be no Conspiracy. Here, the facts state that \"Unbeknownst to Dave, Fred did not actually want to rob the bank.\" Thus, it would seem that there was only one guilty mind. However, as Fred intended to \"explode a hand grenade in a public place,\" Fred had the requisite guilty mind. Pinkerton Rule: Each co-conspirator is held liable for all crimes that were in furtherance of the criminal objective, and all that were foreseeable. Here, the facts state that Dave did not know that Fred had a grenade, and that Dave was \"astonished\" when Fred removed the grenade from his pocket. However, the use of force by use of a deadly weapon (here, grenade) is foreseeable, as even Dave had a gun drawn. Thus, Fred's acts in relation to the grenade are foreseeable. Therefore, Dave will be guilty of crimes related to Fred's use of the grenade. Malicious Mischief: Damage or destruction of the personal property of another with malice. Here, the \"explosion damaged the bank, but did not hurt anyone.\" Thus, there was damage to the personal property of another (bank owner). Furthermore, Malice can be shown by having the specific intent to commit the crime, or a reckless disregard of an obvious risk. Here, Fred had a specific intent to carry out the \"act of terror.\" Thus, Dave can be reasonably charged with Malicious Mischief, through the vicarious liability imposed on him through the Pinkerton Rule. Attempted Robbery: A substantial step toward the commission of a Robbery with the intent to commit the Robbery. Here, Dave had his gun drawn, entered into the bank, and had the specific intent to commit a Robbery, as the facts state that \"Dave suggested to Fred that they rob a bank.\" Thus, Dave and Fred came dangerously close to the commission of a Robbery. Therefore, Dave can be reasonably charged with Attempted Robbery. Robbery: Trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another from the person or their presence, by use of force or threats of force, with the intent to permanently deprive. Here, as the facts do not state that Dave actually took control and dominion of any personal property from the bank, nor satisfied the element of asportation, he cannot be found guilty of Robbery. Larceny: Trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive or steal. Here, similarly, Dave cannot be found guilty of Larceny. Aggravated Assault: Assault with a deadly weapon. Assault is intentionally causing a reasonable apprehension of receiving an immediate battery. Here, Dave and Fred were using guns, and a grenade (deadly weapons). Additionally, they intentionally caused Gus to reasonably apprehend that he would receive an immediate battery, as there was an apparent ability to carry out the battery by use of gun or explosive. Therefore, Dave can be reasonably charged with committing an Aggravated Assault. Burglary: Trespassory breaking and entering into the dwelling house of another, in the nighttime, with the intent to commit a felony therein. Here, Fred and Dave entered into the bank, with the specific intent to rob the bank. However, a bank is not a dwelling house. Furthermore, the facts state that Fred and Dave entered the bank \"The next day.\" Therefore, Dave cannot be charged for Common Law Burglary. Statutory Burglary: Entry into any structure with the intent to commit a crime therein. Here, Fred and Dave entered as the facts state that they \"walked in the bank's front door.\" The bank is a structure. Finally, they had the specific intent to commit a robbery therein (a crime). Therefore, Dave can reasonably be charged with Modern Burglary, but not Common Law Burglary. Murder: A homicide with malice aforethought. Homicide: The killing of one human being by another. The defendant's act must have been the actual and proximate cause of the victim's death. Killing of One Human Being: No particular means are required. Here, Fred, a human being was killed. Actual Cause: The defendant will be the actual cause of the victim's death if they would not have died but for the defendant's act. Otherwise, if there are multiple sufficient causes, the defendant will be the actual cause of the victim's death if their actions were a Substantial factor in bringing about the victim's death. Here, Fred would not have died, but for the bank guard, Gus, shooting his gun at Fred, killing him.\" However, as Dave was an accomplice to the crime, he is a Substantial Factor in bringing about Fred's death, and will be found to be the actual cause. Year and a Day Rule: Under the Common Law, the victim must die within one year and one day from the date of the incident. Here, Fred died instantly. Thus, this element is satisfied. Proximate Cause: The defendant will be the indirect proximate cause of the victim's death if there was an intervening act by a third party or act of God, and the intervening act was foreseeable. Here, the bank guard, Gus, made an effort to protect persons and property of the bank. Efforts to protect persons or property are considered foreseeable. Thus, the intervening act of Gus was foreseeable. Therefore, Dave's act of burglary is the indirect Proximate cause of Fred's death. Therefore, Dave is criminally liable for the homicide of Fred. Malice: Malice can be established by one of the following: Intent to Kill: Here, the facts do not show that Dave had the specific intent to kill Fred, nor knowledge of substantial certainty that Dave's death would occur. Thus, Malice will not be shown this way. Intent to Cause Serious Bodily Injury: Here, the facts do not show that Dave had the specific intent to cause Fred any serious bodily injury, as Dave and Fred were running away together. Thus, Malice will not be shown this way. Wanton Conduct: Showing an extreme indifference to the value of human life by an act that poses a very high risk of death, has little or no social value, done intentionally, where the defendant was aware of the risk. Here, Dave's conduct of Attempted Robbery with use of a gun (deadly weapon) constituted an act that posed a very high risk of death, and which had little or no social value, which was also done intentionally, and where Dave was aware of the risk that his actions posed. Thus, Dave can be found to have committed Wanton Conduct. However, if the courts do not find that Dave's conduct amounted to Wanton Conduct, the next best theory is Involuntary Manslaughter. Felony Murder Rule: When a death is caused during the perpetration of an inherently dangerous, collateral felony, then the underlying felony will replace and satisfy the element of Malice. Here, Dave was engaged in the act of Attempted Robbery with a deadly weapon. Thus, his act was inherently dangerous, as it posed a high risk of death. Additionally, the crime of Robbery is collateral and independent to the act which actually brought about the homicide of Fred. Thus, the Attempted Robbery by Dave will replace and satisfy the element of Malice. Res Gestae: The death must occur during the perpetration of the felony, for the defendant to be found guilty. The Res Gestae begins when the attempt of the felony becomes viable and lasts until the felon(s) reach a place of temporary or seeming safety. Here, Dave was in the bank with a gun. Thus, the attempt to rob became viable. Further, the facts state that \"Dave and Fred were running away with their guns drawn.\" Thus, they did not reach a place of temporary or seeming safety, as they were still fleeing when Fred was shot by Gus. Thus, the death occurred during the Res Gestae. Red-line View: Under the Common Law, when a co-felon dies at the hands of another, the defendant will be found guilty of Felony Murder. However, under the modern Red-line View, a defendant will not be held guilty of Felony Murder when a cofelon dies at the hands of an innocent third party. Here, Gus is an innocent third party, who actually shot and killed Fred, the co-felon. Thus, if the jurisdiction follows the Redline View, then Dave will Not be found guilty of Felony murder. However, under Common Law, Dave will be found guilty of Felony Murder. First Degree Felony Murder: When a death occurs during the perpetration of an enumerated felony. Traditionally, Burglary and Robbery are both considered enumerated felonies. Thus, if Dave is found guilty of Felony Murder (established above), he can also be reasonably found guilty of First- Degree Felony Murder. Involuntary Manslaughter: Homicide without malice while committing a wrongful act. Here, if Dave is not found guilty of Felony Murder, and his conduct is not found to amount to Wanton Conduct, then the next best theory is Involuntary Manslaughter. Dave is liable for the homicide of Fred (established above). If malice cannot be found, then Dave’s wrongful act of Assault will suffice. Therefore, Dave can be reasonably charged with Involuntary Manslaughter. Therefore, Dave can be reasonably charged with committing Solicitation, Conspiracy, Attempted Robbery, Statutory Burglary, Malicious Mischief, Aggravated Assault, Second Degree Felony Murder or First- Degree Felony Murder, or Involuntary Manslaughte",

Crucially, the student identifies that the shooter was a third party (Gus) and **analyzes Dave's liability under both the Majority \"Agency Theory\" and the Minority \"Proximate Cause Theory,\"** explaining the different outcomes under each. <br><br> **- Conspiracy:** Correctly analyzes the conspiracy charge, noting the issue of Fred’s feigned agreement. Discusses the distinction between the traditional **bilateral approach** (requiring a true \"meeting of the minds\") and the modern **unilateral/MPC approach** (where only one party needs genuine intent), concluding Dave is likely guilty of conspiracy under the modern view. <br><br> **- Co-Conspirator Liability (Pinkerton Rule):** Thoughtfully analyzes whether Dave is liable for Fred's act of exploding the grenade. Correctly applies the Pinkerton rule, arguing persuasively whether the act was both **foreseeable** and **in furtherance of** the original bank robbery conspiracy (likely concluding it was neither). <br><br> **- Attempt:** Clearly applies the facts (approaching with guns drawn) to the \"substantial step\" element of attempt. |\n| **35-44 pts** | **Proficient** | **- Felony Murder:** Correctly analyzes felony murder but discusses only **one** of the major theories (typically the agency theory) without acknowledging the alternative, leading to a sound but incomplete analysis. <br><br> **- Conspiracy:** Identifies the conspiracy and correctly applies the elements but may not fully explore the nuance of the unilateral/bilateral distinction, or does so in a cursory manner. <br><br> **- Co-Conspirator Liability:** Acknowledges that Dave is likely not responsible for the grenade but provides a shallow analysis, perhaps only stating it wasn't foreseeable without discussing the \"in furtherance of\" prong of the Pinkerton rule. <br><br> **- Attempt:** Correctly analyzes the attempted robbery charge. |\n| **25-34 pts** | **Developing** | **- Felony Murder:** Analysis is conclusory or flawed. For example, states \"Dave is guilty of felony murder because Fred died during a felony\" without analyzing who did the killing or the relevant legal theories. <br><br> **- Conspiracy / Co-Conspirator Liability:** Shows confusion between direct liability and co-conspirator liability. May incorrectly hold Dave responsible for the grenade because he was a co-conspirator, without proper application of the Pinkerton rule. <br><br> **- General:** Tends to state conclusions without connecting them back to specific facts or rule elements. The application of law to fact is weak. |\n| **0-24 pts** | **Needs Improvement**| - Fails to engage in substantive legal analysis, largely just restating facts. <br>- Application of rules is illogical, fundamentally incorrect, or absent. <br>- Shows a significant misunderstanding of core criminal law concepts like felony murder or conspiracy. |\n\n---\n\n### **2.

  "assessment": "Of course. As a legal writing professor, I will provide a comprehensive assessment of the student's answer, using the provided materials and following a structured framework.\n\n### **Overall Assessment of the Student's Answer**\n\nThis is a strong and well-organized answer that demonstrates a solid grasp of fundamental criminal law concepts. The student correctly identified the three most significant charges against Dave (Conspiracy, Attempted Robbery, and Felony Murder) and structured the analysis clearly using a C-REAC (Claim-Rule-Explanation-Application-Conclusion) format. The reasoning is generally sound, and the conclusions are logical.\n\nThe primary area for improvement lies in **analytical depth**. While the student identifies the correct issues, the analysis does not always explore the critical nuances and jurisdictional splits that a top-tier answer would include. Specifically, the discussion of felony murder and conspiracy could be significantly deepened by incorporating the competing legal theories detailed in the rubric.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Feedback Based on the Rubric**\n\nHere is a breakdown of the student's performance against each criterion in the rubric.\n\n#### **1. Analytical Depth (Score: 35/50 - Proficient)**\n\nThis is where the student performed well but has the most room for growth.\n\n*   **Felony Murder:** The student correctly identifies that Fred’s death occurred during an inherently dangerous felony (attempted robbery) and that the killer was a third party (Gus, the guard). This is a good start. The analysis mentions the defense that a \"third party acting in resistance\" may absolve Dave of guilt and correctly identifies the \"proximate cause theory\" as a counterargument.\n    *   **Area for Improvement:** The analysis is incomplete. To reach the \"Excellent\" level, the student needed to explicitly name and contrast the two competing rules:\n        *   **The Agency Theory (Majority Rule / \"Redline Rule\"):** Under this theory, a defendant is only liable for killings committed by their \"agents\" (i.e., co-felons). Since Gus was a third party resisting the felony, Dave would **not** be guilty of felony murder under this majority view. The student's point about \"some jurisdictions\" alludes to this but lacks the doctrinal precision.\n        *   **The Proximate Cause Theory (Minority Rule):** Under this theory, a felon is liable for any death that is the proximate result of the felony. The student correctly applied this, noting the death was a foreseeable result of the robbery.\n    *   By failing to articulate the majority Agency Theory by name and contrast it with the minority rule, the analysis, while proficient, misses the central legal tension of the felony murder issue.\n\n*   **Conspiracy:** The student correctly identifies the elements of agreement and an overt act. However, the analysis of the agreement is too simplistic. It states, \"It does not matter that Fred had a different motive; as long as he agreed to rob the bank, the conspiracy is formed.\"\n    *   **Area for Improvement:** This conclusion ignores the significant legal problem of **feigned agreement**. Fred did *not* actually want to rob the bank. A top-tier answer would analyze this using the two approaches to conspiracy:\n        *   **Bilateral Approach (Common Law):** Requires a true \"meeting of the minds.\" Since Fred was only feigning agreement, there was no actual meeting of the minds, and thus, **no conspiracy** under this traditional view.\n        *   **Unilateral Approach (Modern/MPC View):** Requires only that the defendant (Dave) genuinely agreed to commit the crime, regardless of the other party's secret intent. Under this modern view, **Dave is guilty of conspiracy**. The analysis should have discussed this split.\n\n*   **Co-Conspirator Liability (Grenade):** The student correctly concludes Dave is not liable for the bombing, noting it was \"outside the scope of the robbery plan.\" This demonstrates good legal intuition.\n    *   **Area for Improvement:** The analysis would be stronger by explicitly invoking the **Pinkerton Rule** and its two-prong test. The student should have argued that exploding the grenade was neither **(1) in furtherance of** the bank robbery (it was in furtherance of Fred's separate terroristic goal) nor **(2) a reasonably foreseeable** consequence of the planned robbery. Using the rule's specific language adds analytical rigor.\n\n#### **2. Rule Statement (Score: 15/20 - Proficient)**\n\nThe student's rule statements are generally correct but lack the completeness required for an excellent score.\n\n*   **Strengths:** The definitions for conspiracy, attempt, and the general felony murder rule are accurate.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** The rule statements are missing the critical nuances needed to analyze the facts fully. As noted above, the felony murder rule statement needed to include the Agency and Proximate Cause theories. The conspiracy rule would have been improved by mentioning the bilateral/unilateral distinction. A more complete rule section sets the stage for a more sophisticated analysis.\n\n#### **3. Issue Spotting (Score: 12/15 - Proficient)**\n\nThe student did a good job of identifying the major issues.\n\n*   **Strengths:** The student correctly identified the three most important and complex charges: Conspiracy, Attempted Robbery, and Felony Murder. The student also correctly spotted the issue of liability for the grenade, even if framing it as \"Destruction of Property\" rather than through the lens of co-conspirator liability.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** The answer missed some of the secondary crimes identified in the model answer, such as Solicitation (which merges), Statutory Burglary, and Aggravated Assault. While less central than the main three, spotting these demonstrates a comprehensive reading of the facts. The most significant missed issue was analyzing liability for the *grenade explosion* under the specific doctrine of co-conspirator liability (Pinkerton).\n\n#### **4. Organization (Score: 14/15 - Excellent)**\n\nThe organization is a clear strength of this answer.\n\n*   **Strengths:** The student uses a non-IRAC format (C-REAC), but it is applied consistently and effectively. Headings for each crime make the answer easy to navigate and read. The separation of Rule, Explanation, and Application creates a logical flow that is easy for the reader to follow. This is professional, clear, and demonstrates a command of legal writing structure.\n\n### **Final Score and Concluding Remarks**\n\n**Overall Score: 76/100 (Proficient)**\n\nThis student is on the right track to producing excellent legal analysis. The core skills of issue spotting, articulating general rules, and organizing an answer are strong.\n\n**To advance from \"Proficient\" to \"Excellent,\" focus on the following:**\n\n1.  **Master the Nuances:** When you state a rule like felony murder or conspiracy, ask yourself: \"Is there a split in jurisdictions? Are there competing theories?\" Actively look for these tensions (e.g., Agency vs. Proximate Cause; Bilateral vs. Unilateral) and define them in your rule section.\n2.  **Analyze Both Sides:** Once you've identified a doctrinal split, apply the facts to *both* sides. Explaining why Dave would be guilty under one theory but not guilty under another is the hallmark of sophisticated legal analysis.\n3.  **Use Doctrinal Names:** When you identify a concept, use its name. Instead of saying \"liability for crimes committed by a co-conspirator,\" say \"**The Pinkerton Rule** holds that...\" Instead of \"some jurisdictions say you're not liable if a non-felon does the killing,\" say \"Under the majority **Agency Theory** or **Redline Rule**...\" This signals a higher level of mastery to your reader.\n\nExcellent effort. With a deeper dive into the doctrinal details, this student's work will be truly outstanding."
